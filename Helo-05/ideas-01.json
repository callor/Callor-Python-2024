Implement a function to generate positive and negative pairs of character sequences: positive pairs could be consecutive sequences, while negative pairs could be randomly sampled from non-consecutive contexts. Update the model's loss calculation to include the contrastive loss term, possibly using a subset of data to manage computational overhead. Ensure the use of existing functions for loss and data handling. Assess performance improvements through validation loss, generalization capability, and specific metrics like text generation coherence and perplexity reduction.",
